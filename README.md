## Challenge 1
## ✨ Features

- **Models**: Implements `EfficientNet-B3` and `ResNet-50` for robust classification.

- **Data Augmentation**: Includes resizing to `245x245`, random flipping, rotation, and color jittering to improve model generalization.

- **Focal Loss**: Helps address class imbalance by focusing more on hard-to-classify examples during training.

- **Ensemble Method**: Combines predictions from multiple models to enhance overall accuracy and reduce variance.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides detailed performance insights using **accuracy**, **F1 scores**, **confusion matrices**, and **misclassification analysis**.

---
## 📈 Results

The project achieves impressive performance across individual models and the ensemble:

### 🔹 EfficientNet-B3
- **F1 Score**: `0.9783`
- **Accuracy**: `97.14%`

### 🔹 ResNet-50
- **F1 Score**: `1.0000`
- **Accuracy**: `98.78%`

### 🔹 Ensemble
- **F1 Score**: `0.9957`
- **Accuracy**: `99.59%`

📊 Visualizations such as **confusion matrices** and **misclassification rates** are saved in `/kaggle/working/` for detailed analysis.
